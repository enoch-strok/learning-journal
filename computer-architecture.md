# How Computers Work
- Started out as calculators.
- Were created to help us solve problems and with work.
- Computers used to be made out of mechanical parts, but then later changed to electrical components.
- Computers communicate using the binary system.
- Computers communicate using wires to send signals. (On is 1, off is 0).
- Letters can be represented by numbers.
- Videos and Pictures can be represtented by numbers.
- Sound can be represented by numbers.
- Circuits can change the output of signals.
- Combining multiple circuits allows us to calculate larger equations.
- Operating Systems manage which software can use the hardware on a computer and sends those signals to   the hardware in bianary code to perform those functions.
