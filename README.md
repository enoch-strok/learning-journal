**Definition of growth mindset:**
> A "Growth Mindset" is a choice to have the perspective of being able to perservere and not giving up. It is means we are flexible and optimistic about any given situation and that we are willing to be stretched.

**Reminders for myself to stay in this mentality:**
- Be optimistic.
- Dont give up.
- Take it step by step.
- ~Be passive.~
