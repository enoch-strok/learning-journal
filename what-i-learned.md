##### What did I learn from this exercise?
> This exercise, Lab 03: Revisions and the Cloud, has taught me that repitition is very helpful in learning how to become a better coder (in markdown). I also learned that sometimes the issue that were having, and maybe even most of the time, is user error, and not always software issues (unless you own a windows machine haha). This exercise really stretched me, but I actually really enjoyed it (after the fact) because I feel MUCH more comfortable with the whole process now. I also do like the checks and balances that exist in git/github.
